"""I'm trying to solve a school scheduling problem using the SAT solver. Since is similar to the nurse scheduling problem (https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/master/examples/python/nurses_sat.py)  I used a similar approach, but I'm having some trouble with a constraint, I would like to ask you for your guidance since i've been stuck for a while now.
In this problem I have courses, subjects, teachers and timeslots. , A course is made of a level (first grade, second grade, etc) and a section (A, B), for example 1째A, 1째B, 2째A, ...., subjects are Math, English, History, etc, We have t Teachers, each one with some skills that allow them to teach some subjects and the timeslots are when the subjects are taught. Also, every level contains a curriculum, that is the quantity of timeslots per subject required, for example all the first grades need to have 5 timeslots of english, 3 of math, and so on.
So we have some restrictions:
+ A teacher cannot teach more than 1 class simultaneosly
+ A teacher can only teach subjects of his/her set of skills (specialties)
+ Each course must meet the quantity of classes speicfied in the curriculum
+ Each teacher has a maximum number of working hours (here hours == timeslots)
- For a given course and subject, the teacher must be the same for all of them (ex: 1째A has only one Math teacher)
I modeled the problem as a big boolean matrix: assign[c, s, t, ts] = 1 if teacher t is assigned to course c and subject s in timeslot ts, and I've been able to add all the constraints but the last one."""
